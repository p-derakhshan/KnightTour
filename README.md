# KnightTour
Given a square chessboard of N x N size and the position of Knight, this program finds out the sequence of moves needed for the night to take a tour over the chessboard.
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square, the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.
